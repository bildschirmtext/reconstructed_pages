If you want to support this project, add metadata for the pages.

Pull-Requests are welcome.

The `meta.yml` file contains metadata for each page. For each page, which is named after the base of its filename there are the following properties:

* org: The name of the organisation this page is from or for, typically found on the top of the screen
* based-on: If a page is based on another page, add the filename of it.
* tags: A list of tags for that page
* links: A list of likely links to other pages here
* pageno: If there's a page number of that page on that page, add it here.
* desc: Description of that page
* title: A title for that page
* after: If the page seems to be part of a sequence, this page will be sorted after the other page
* before: like after, but before
